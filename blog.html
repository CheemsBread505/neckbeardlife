<h3>I just had the best neckbeard day ever.</h3>
<p>
    I just went to target and I wore my fedora, 
    <br>
    I bought magic the gathering cards, mountain dew, and axe body spray. 
    <br>
    there was a nice m'lady at the check out I tipped my fedora after she scanned my axe body spray and dew. 
    <br>
    and now I'm gonna play LEGO StarWars and minecraft.
    <br>
    <br>
    today was a good day :)

        I made a reddit premium member card. 
        I designed it in photoshop and my dad printed it and my mom laminated it for me, 
        I hope it looks good!

    <div class="card">
